What is ADeLE
================
ADeLE is the system implementation of our Policy-based, Virtual Network Embedding Architecture, that use an asynchrnous implementation of the  protocol for Consensus-based Distributed virtual network Embedding (CADE). Details of the CADE protocol (formerly called CAD) can be found at http://csr.bu.edu/cad
